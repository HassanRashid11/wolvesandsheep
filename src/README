Notes to self.


The .jar produced by this project needs to be signed before deployment.  "sign" does that. (new keys may have to be generated.)

sync.sh signs and uploads the produced .jar to server.   Clean&build in Netbeans before doing that.
use a softlink and run it from the project directory.

test-was.sh is needed if .jar files are run from within NetBeans (with graphical output).  This will strip them of the "was" packages, most importantly.
run it from the project directory.

run.py runs the tournament (either free-form, or as defined by ClassTournament.teamStructureInit).  
This is typically a cron job on the server.
If set up to run the class tournament, it'll keep repeating it for a set number of
minutes before producing output in a specified HTML file.
